The organizers of a music festival have several offices in the country where tickets to the festival are sold. Each office uses a software system to sell tickets. The person from each office uses a desktop application with the following functionalities:

1. Login. After successful login, a new window opens displaying all the artists (name, date and venue of the performance, number of seats available and number of seats already sold). An artist can perform several shows.

2. Search. After successfully logging in, the person at the office can search for artists performing on a particular day. The application will display in another list/table all the artists performing that day, the location, the start time and the number of seats available.

3. Purchase. The employee can sell tickets for a specific show. For sale, enter the name of the buyer and the number of desired seats. After the sale all employees from all offices see the updated list of shows. If there are no more seats available at a show, the show will be displayed in red.
